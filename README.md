This is a standard Java Console Application. It was coded using Spring Boot since the libraries 
are easliy accessible. 

If an IDE is not used, the program may be compiled using 
- mvn clean install

Then it is run using 
- java -jar photoalbum-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 3 ( 3 is the number of the album desired)



# PhotoAlbum
<p>Create a console application that displays photo ids and titles in an album. The photos are available in this online web 
service: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos</p>
<p>Hint: Photos are filtered with a query string. This will return photos within albumId=3
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos?albumId=3</p>
